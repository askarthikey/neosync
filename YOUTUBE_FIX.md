## How to Test:

1. **Start both servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Server
   cd server && npm run dev

   # Terminal 2 - Client  
   cd client && bun dev
   ```

2. **Setup Requirements:**
   - Content creator must connect their YouTube account first
   - Editor must be assigned to a completed project
   - Project status should be "Completed"

3. **Testing Steps:**
   - Login as an editor
   - Open a completed project
   - Click "Upload to YouTube" button
   - Fill in the form and select a video file
   - Monitor browser console and server logs for detailed feedback

## Current Environment:
- YouTube API credentials are properly configured
- OAuth2 client setup is working correctly
- All required Google API scopes are included

## Notes:
- Videos are uploaded as "private" by default for creator review
- The creator needs to have an active YouTube channel
- File size limits and format validation are in place
- Token refresh is automatically handled when needed
